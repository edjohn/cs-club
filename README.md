    - Fall 2020: https://github.com/edjohn/cs-club/blob/master/README_FA2020.md

- **Is there a formal document that outlines the club's logistics and vision?**
   - Nobody has ever actually asked this question but it's definitely an important question to ask. Here's our official written constitution: https://github.com/edjohn/cs-club/blob/master/student_org_constitution.pdf. The preamble, mission statement, and purpose are what we form this club around. If you ever feel we're veering off course, let us know so we can improve!
