- **How can I become a member of the club council?**
    - Council members are picked out by the current council and officers. All it requires is that you participate in the club and make some contributions!
      Helping out other students, volunteering to organize a club activity, sharing informational resources, and being involved during meetings are all good ways to contribute.
- **I have a suggestion or a concern. Who can I contact regarding this?**
  - Our club operates democratically, so feel free to contact any of the officers on Discord (currently Edward#4272, Jose Sepulveda#6216, or wake#4409). We conduct polls often to decide on various logistics or future activities, so we do value your feedback.
- **Where can I find records of previous meetings/activities?**
  - Aside from coding competitions and guest lectures, you can see everything we've done in previous semesters here: 
    - Fall 2020: https://github.com/edjohn/cs-club/blob/master/README_FA2020.md 
    - Spring 2021: https://github.com/edjohn/cs-club/blob/master/README_SP2021.md
    - Fall 2021: https://github.com/edjohn/cs-club/blob/master/README_FA2021.md
- **Is there a formal document that outlines the club's logistics and vision?**
   - Nobody has ever actually asked this question but it's definitely an important question to ask. Here's our official written constitution: https://github.com/edjohn/cs-club/blob/master/student_org_constitution.pdf. The preamble, mission statement, and purpose are what we form this club around. If you ever feel we're veering off course, let us know so we can improve!

- *Meeting Date: 02/04/2022*
1. Create a HackerRank account at https://www.hackerrank.com/auth/signup.
2. Sign up for our first coding competition of 2022 at https://www.hackerrank.com/bccs-sp2022-first-meeting.
3. That's it! The coding challenges for our competition will be straightforward algorithmic puzzles, but first you might want to sharpen up on your syntax. 
   You can use any language, but try to stick to one you're familiar with. Here are links to practice with the three most popular ones.
   - Python Challenges https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python
   - Java Challenges https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java
   - C++ Challenges https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp
4. Attend our meeting on Friday at 3:00 PM on Discord! The competition itself will last from 3:15-4:30 PM. Think of this competition as just practice for what's to come, because we may have something bigger in store for you later in the semester!
