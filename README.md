## FAQ

  - You attend meetings by joining the meeting voice channel and #meeting text channel in our Discord. During guest lectures, we may use a zoom link that'll mention in the #announcements chat.

- **How can I become an official member of the club?**

- **I have a suggestion or a concern. Who can I contact regarding this?**
  - Our club operates on a democratic basis, so feel free to contact any of the officers on Discord: Edward#4272, goose#8888, or Jose Sepulveda#6216. We conduct polls often to decide on various logistics or future activities, so we do value your feedback.
- **Where can I find records of previous meetings/activities?**
  - Aside from Hackathons and guest lectures, you can see everything we've done in Spring 2020 here: https://github.com/edjohn/cs-club/edit/master/README_2020.md
- **Is there a formal document that outlines the club's logistics and vision?**
   - Nobody has ever actually asked this question but it's definitely an important question to ask. Here's our official written constitution: https://github.com/edjohn/cs-club/blob/master/student_org_constitution.pdf. The preamble, mission statement, and purpose are what we form this club around. If you ever feel we're veering off course, let us know so we can improve!
