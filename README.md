  - Aside from Hackathons and guest lectures, you can see everything we've done in Spring 2020 here: https://github.com/edjohn/cs-club/edit/master/README_2020.md
- **Is there a formal document that outlines the club's logistics and vision?**
   - Nobody has ever actually asked this question but it's definitely an important question to ask. Here's our official written constitution: https://github.com/edjohn/cs-club/blob/master/student_org_constitution.pdf. The preamble, mission statement, and purpose are what we form this club around. If you ever feel we're veering off course, let us know so we can improve!

   2. If you want, you can apply for the student developer pack at https://store.unity.com/academic/unity-student
3. Open Unity Hub and log in with your account. Click on **Installs** and download the latest official release (recommended release may not work for our meeting activity)

    1. For the most part, you'll have to do some experimentation, documentation reading, and browsing to get through these tutorials. These tutorials vary in scripting, genre, time investment, and purpose so look for something that you'll find interesting!
 5. If you're attending the unity workshop, download https://github.com/edjohn/cs-club/tree/master/unity-workshop to have it ready for the meeting. You'll be implementing the core game functionality for a basic clicker game through a bit of object-oriented programming.
