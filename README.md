## FAQ
- **Where can I join the Discord for the club?**
  - Here's the link to our Discord: [https://discord.com/invite/KuebcYY](https://discord.com/invite/KuebcYY). This is our communication hub where you can receive announcements and chat with other members.
- **Where do I attend meetings?**
  - Typically, a zoom link will be mentioned in the #announcements chat channel in Discord.
- **When are the meetings?**
  - Meetings are currently on biweekly Fridays of the month, lasting from 5:00-6:00 PM. Here are the official dates:

- **How can I become an official member of the club?**
  - We track "official" membership (aka meeting attendees) through the member role in Discord. If you attend any meeting, you'll be given the role. If you've attended a meeting on Zoom, just let an officer know if your name is different from your Discord name.
- **I have a suggestion or a concern. Who can I contact regarding this?**
  - Our club operates democratically, so feel free to contact any of the officers on Discord (currently Edward#4272, Jose Sepulveda#6216, or wake#4409). We conduct polls often to decide on various logistics or future activities, so we do value your feedback.
- **Where can I find records of previous meetings/activities?**
  - Aside from Hackathons and guest lectures, you can see everything we've done in Fall 2020 here: https://github.com/edjohn/cs-club/blob/master/README_FA2020.md and everything from Spring 2021 here: https://github.com/edjohn/cs-club/blob/master/README_SP2021.md.
- **Is there a formal document that outlines the club's logistics and vision?**
   - Nobody has ever actually asked this question but it's definitely an important question to ask. Here's our official written constitution: https://github.com/edjohn/cs-club/blob/master/student_org_constitution.pdf. The preamble, mission statement, and purpose are what we form this club around. If you ever feel we're veering off course, let us know so we can improve!
